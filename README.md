# 2023 AMC 12 Problems in Lean
This repository contains our formalization of the 2023 AMC 12 problems in Lean.

### Formalization
We obtained the problems through Art of Problem Solving (https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_12_Problems_and_Solutions).
Next, the entire set of 2023 problems was formalized in Lean using ChatGPT, excluding problems that required figures.
Each formalized problem was carefully reviewed and adjusted to align with Lean's syntax while preserving the intent of the original problem.

As a result, we successfully formalized 26 out of 50 questions, which are documented in `src/test.lean`.
